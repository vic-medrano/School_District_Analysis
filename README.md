# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze data for an entire school district. The project analyzed funding for the district as well as the grades of students in the district. Claims of academic dishonesty caused the project to be conducted again.
## Results

    - The district was affected by a percentage decrease of less than 1% for average math scores, percentage of passing math students, percentage of passing reading students, and the overal passing percentage. However, the average reading scores were not affected.
 - How is the school summary affected?
    - For the Thomas high school summary, the percentage of passing math students dropped significantly by 26%. Percentage of passing reading students (27.6%) and overall passing percentages also experienced a decrease (25.8%).

 - How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's Performance relative to other schools?
    - Replacing the scores of the ninth graders decreased the overall passing percentage for THS as well as the distirct by less than a percent. It also did not affect their ranking among the top performing schools in the district 
 - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    -  Math and Reading Scores by grade: There are not very significant differences when it comes to scores across grade levels.
    - Scores by school spending: In regard to school budget and performance, schools with larger budgets per student were not found to increase performance. This finding indicates additional factors other than funding may be invovlved in performance.
    - Scores by school size: The data also found that larger schools tended to have the lowest average and passing percentages.

    - Scores by school type: When compared to the district schools, charter schools have higer performing grades. All of the schools in the top five schools with the highers overall passing percentages are Charter schools. The lowest five performing schools were all district schools.

 ## Summary
 To prevent innacurate data and in an attempt to lessen the extent of academic dishonesty, the scores of the ninth grade students were removed from the data set. This is not ideal, however, it is necessary to retain accurate data. It can be concluded that removal of the ninth graders scores did not change the standing of Thomas High School or significantly decrease the overall passing percentage of students for Thomas high school.
